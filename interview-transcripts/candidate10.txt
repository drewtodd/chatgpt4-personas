0:0:51.610 --> 0:0:52.380
Interviewer
OK.
0:0:52.590 --> 0:0:53.830
Interviewer
And are you a parent?
0:0:54.560 --> 0:0:56.290
Dean Liou
Yeah, I've got two daughters.
0:0:57.10 --> 0:0:58.140
Interviewer
$2.00, what are their ages?
0:0:58.790 --> 0:1:0.200
Dean Liou
They're 14 and 12.
0:1:1.450 --> 0:1:2.180
Interviewer
OK.
0:1:2.670 --> 0:1:5.870
Interviewer
And this with regards to stickers, why do you purchase stickers?
0:1:7.460 --> 0:1:18.270
Dean Liou
We have this game that's going on at home to where we use stickers as awards, almost like badges like you have online, but except these are in real life.
0:1:18.280 --> 0:1:24.110
Dean Liou
So whenever they do a certain thing, we've got some stickers that says you did the dishes and you get a sticker for that.
0:1:24.120 --> 0:1:27.550
Dean Liou
Or it's like you took out the trash and then you'll get a sticker for that.
0:1:27.560 --> 0:1:29.390
Dean Liou
And these are the stickers that we get from you guys.
0:1:29.400 --> 0:1:32.230
Dean Liou
We kind of design our own, so yeah.
0:1:34.130 --> 0:1:34.920
Interviewer
OK, very cool.
0:1:37.990 --> 0:1:42.390
Interviewer
So what kind of stickers do your I assume again the the stickers are free.
0:1:42.400 --> 0:1:43.150
Interviewer
Your daughters?
0:1:43.330 --> 0:1:44.540
Interviewer
What kind of stickers do they like?
0:1:45.810 --> 0:1:48.800
Dean Liou
Uh, they like the ones that are, like, real colorful.
0:1:49.310 --> 0:1:54.470
Dean Liou
Also, we like the ones that are are are repositionable, so they're not permanent.
0:1:54.530 --> 0:1:57.540
Dean Liou
So you've got you've got the ones that are kind of like post it notes.
0:1:57.550 --> 0:1:58.270
Dean Liou
We like those kind.
0:1:59.300 --> 0:2:0.520
Interviewer
OK, great.
0:2:2.280 --> 0:2:3.950
Interviewer
What motivates you to purchase stickers?
0:2:4.480 --> 0:2:6.610
Interviewer
Maybe a little redundant, but I'll ask the question anyway.
0:2:6.310 --> 0:2:7.850
Dean Liou
Well, no, I'm.
0:2:7.970 --> 0:2:16.730
Dean Liou
There's some things like your your website, it's just slightly cheaper than the rest and you guys have free shipping and you know that that free shipping really adds up.
0:2:18.410 --> 0:2:19.40
Interviewer
Right.
0:2:19.280 --> 0:2:20.810
Interviewer
How often do you purchase the stickers?
0:2:22.190 --> 0:2:28.170
Dean Liou
I would say maybe twice a month, every two weeks.
0:2:29.770 --> 0:2:40.460
Interviewer
OK, so if you had to rank in order of importance with one being the most important and four being the least important, how would you identify the following factors when purchasing stickers?
0:2:40.610 --> 0:2:50.830
Interviewer
The four factors are price, quality, licensing so like Disney or Marvel superheroes or sports teams, things like that or customization.
0:2:50.840 --> 0:2:53.880
Interviewer
So again, price, quality, licensing and customization.
0:2:55.170 --> 0:2:58.600
Dean Liou
Uh, I would say the first thing is price because I'm cheap.
0:2:59.220 --> 0:2:59.630
Interviewer
OK.
0:2:58.710 --> 0:3:0.170
Dean Liou
And besides, these are for the kids.
0:3:1.960 --> 0:3:9.730
Dean Liou
But the second one would actually be customization because I wanna make my own kind of stickers and we have that little game going on.
0:3:9.740 --> 0:3:14.650
Dean Liou
Whether we I get to, they get to design their stickers and qualities.
0:3:14.660 --> 0:3:22.810
Dean Liou
Probably the third one because it can't be junkie, but the licensing not so important to us because we're customizing our own.
0:3:23.710 --> 0:3:25.170
Interviewer
Great. Perfect.
0:3:25.260 --> 0:3:27.760
Interviewer
Have you purchased stickers from stickermeat.com before?
0:3:28.320 --> 0:3:29.120
Dean Liou
Yes, definitely.
0:3:30.50 --> 0:3:32.120
Interviewer
Have you purchased stickers from other online vendors?
0:3:33.230 --> 0:3:33.920
Dean Liou
Uh, yeah.
0:3:33.970 --> 0:3:43.190
Dean Liou
Well, Amazon used to offer a service where you could customize stuff, but it's actually more expensive and it's slower cause like the shooting speed is important to us.
0:3:44.110 --> 0:3:44.700
Interviewer
Good, cool.
0:3:46.480 --> 0:3:46.900
Interviewer
Uh.
0:3:46.910 --> 0:3:51.500
Interviewer
And so I assume you have if I if I ask have you ever customize your own stickers?
0:3:53.330 --> 0:3:53.770
Dean Liou
Yes.
0:3:54.100 --> 0:3:57.310
Dean Liou
So that's that's the that's the thing we we really like about you guys.
0:3:57.920 --> 0:4:6.690
Dean Liou
What they do is they draw the sticker on paper and then I just use my smartphone, my camera phone to take a picture of it.
0:4:6.700 --> 0:4:17.420
Dean Liou
And then you guys have that, that upload ability where I can upload the sticker and then you've got some cool adjustments you can make on the website, which is really handy because sometimes the the pictures to come out so good.
0:4:18.570 --> 0:4:18.950
Interviewer
OK.
0:4:19.710 --> 0:4:22.10
Interviewer
Have you ever purchased stickers as a gift for someone else?
0:4:23.160 --> 0:4:26.220
Dean Liou
And yet I've only really been using it for a home.
0:4:26.230 --> 0:4:37.200
Dean Liou
But if you wanna say that these stickers I can give to other other parents as as like kind of like a an idea for them to to do stuff with their kids and take care of chores and stuff.
0:4:37.210 --> 0:4:38.550
Dean Liou
I was thinking about doing that.
0:4:38.560 --> 0:4:40.220
Dean Liou
Yeah, but so far not yet.
0:4:41.240 --> 0:4:41.400
Interviewer
OK.
0:4:42.970 --> 0:4:46.350
Interviewer
So with regards to websites, what do you look for in a sticker website?
0:4:48.600 --> 0:4:50.230
Dean Liou
It's gotta be easy to use.
0:4:50.280 --> 0:4:57.430
Dean Liou
I don't wanna have to read a manual to figure out how to operate the customization parts that you've got, and that's pretty good.
0:4:57.550 --> 0:4:58.730
Dean Liou
I was able to figure that out.
0:4:59.730 --> 0:5:0.30
Dean Liou
Uh.
0:5:0.230 --> 0:5:1.590
Dean Liou
Also, it's needs to be fast.
0:5:2.80 --> 0:5:2.540
Dean Liou
Umm.
0:5:3.40 --> 0:5:7.830
Dean Liou
If it's, if it's like hanging and kind of buggy and slow, I don't have time for that.
0:5:9.860 --> 0:5:10.230
Interviewer
Right.
0:5:10.670 --> 0:5:14.270
Interviewer
How do you prefer to navigate a website when you're looking to purchase stickers?
0:5:15.950 --> 0:5:30.960
Dean Liou
Umm, they've got you've got some other other customization, a bit able, like size of the stickers and the type of the the sticky material on the back because I was telling you about how I like the repositionable stickers because I don't want them to be stuck forever.
0:5:31.410 --> 0:5:38.700
Dean Liou
So, like, yeah, sticker types that I like the filters to be able to filter by that kind of stuff, and also by price.
0:5:38.850 --> 0:5:43.740
Dean Liou
So like just being able to do all of those with my customized stickers, that's important.
0:5:44.730 --> 0:5:53.540
Interviewer
Or alright, last question, maybe a bit redundant, but if you could clarify how important is customization to you when purchasing stickers.
0:5:54.120 --> 0:6:7.910
Dean Liou
That is like top of the list next to right after price, so it is important and it you guys need to have that functionality even if you guys were the cheapest sticker company available and didn't have customization, it would still be a deal breaker.
0:6:7.920 --> 0:6:10.430
Dean Liou
So it is very important that I can customize stickers.
0:6:11.400 --> 0:6:14.310
Interviewer
OK, that's the end of our questions for today.
0:6:14.320 --> 0:6:17.390
