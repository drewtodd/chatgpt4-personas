So with regards to stickers, why do you purchase stickers?
0:9:31.300 --> 0:9:39.590
Candidate
Well, I purchased them for the kids and then I also purchased them for for the team and so for the baseball team.
0:9:39.600 --> 0:9:41.310
Candidate
So I started urging them for the kids.
0:9:41.320 --> 0:9:45.890
Candidate
My my son is really big into a really responds well to positive reinforcement.
0:9:45.900 --> 0:9:52.950
Candidate
So when I started to see the stickers that were out, there were just pretty generic and he just he just loves Marvel characters.
0:9:52.960 --> 0:9:59.380
Candidate
But I wanted to kind of customize them a little bit, so I was able to to do that and so I got him for him.
0:9:59.430 --> 0:10:2.210
Candidate
And then I started using them for the team O both purposes really.
0:10:2.760 --> 0:10:3.30
Interviewer
OK.
0:10:3.40 --> 0:10:4.60

How do you use them for the team?
0:10:5.520 --> 0:10:18.190

0:10:19.40 --> 0:10:21.150
Candidate
We've got some on the lockers.
0:10:21.620 --> 0:10:28.970
Candidate
The thing I like about the stickers that I've been buying is that they they come off without leaving a residue too much.
0:10:28.980 --> 0:10:33.250
Candidate
So we're able to get them on and then take them off again without a wrecking whatever I put them on.
0:10:33.260 --> 0:10:35.90
Candidate
So they're good for incentives.
0:10:35.100 --> 0:10:36.50
Candidate
They're kind of fun.
0:10:36.60 --> 0:10:38.710

0:10:39.580 --> 0:10:40.210
Interviewer
OK, great.
0:10:40.220 --> 0:10:43.420
Interviewer
And what kind of stickers do you typically see yourself using?
0:10:44.450 --> 0:10:51.940

Well, mostly ones with either pictures of the teams on them teammates or or for purpose of my kids.
0:10:52.130 --> 0:10:59.120

Sometimes I'll I'll have some custom made that have got superheroes on them or things of our creation.
0:10:59.130 --> 0:11:2.300

I've done a couple where my son drew something and I put that on there as well.
0:11:3.40 --> 0:11:3.400

0:11:4.960 --> 0:11:6.850
Interviewer
And what motivates you to purchase these stickers?
0:11:8.660 --> 0:11:14.320
Candidate
Well, mostly just for helping to create some positive reinforcement.
0:11:14.330 --> 0:11:19.510
Candidate
Letting letting kids know they're, you know, because the stickers themselves are not are not expensive.
0:11:19.520 --> 0:11:26.680
Candidate
So I'm able to give them out and pretty freely and keep things light and happy and motivated, and they tend to stick around for a little while.
0:11:26.700 --> 0:11:29.420
Candidate
And you know, and the kids look at them and remember what they did.
0:11:30.360 --> 0:11:31.90
Interviewer
Great. Great.
0:11:31.100 --> 0:11:33.160
Interviewer
How often do you, uh, typically purchase stickers?
0:11:34.410 --> 0:11:35.200
Candidate
Oh boy.
0:11:35.270 --> 0:11:39.190
Candidate
Last year, last year coming out of COVID, I was buying them.
0:11:39.270 --> 0:11:41.310
Candidate
We were playing for that.
0:11:41.360 --> 0:11:44.800
Candidate
I probably bought maybe once, once a month.
0:11:44.810 --> 0:11:45.660
Candidate
I was buying stickers.
0:11:46.580 --> 0:11:47.170
Interviewer
OK.
0:11:47.860 --> 0:11:54.50
Interviewer
And I'm gonna discuss, or I'm gonna present you with four different factors that go into purchasing stickers.
0:11:54.410 --> 0:11:59.770
Interviewer
If you could rank them in order of importance with the first one being the most important and the 4th, 1 being the least important.
0:12:11.390 --> 0:12:11.710
Candidate
OK.
0:12:0.510 --> 0:12:12.370
Interviewer
Umm, they are priced quality licensing which is kind of like your marble heroes thing you're talking about and customization which would be most important to you.
0:12:12.740 --> 0:12:14.820
Candidate
Most important would be customization.
0:12:15.640 --> 0:12:15.880
Interviewer
OK.
0:12:16.230 --> 0:12:16.580
Candidate
Right.
0:12:16.590 --> 0:12:27.890
Candidate
Uh, I'd say that of course, licensing too, because like I said, the the Marvel thing is was important for my son, not so much for the team.
0:12:30.910 --> 0:12:31.850
Candidate
A licensing.
0:12:31.950 --> 0:12:34.240
Candidate
Is it not just say licensing or customization?
0:12:34.870 --> 0:12:41.300
Candidate
Anyway, Customization's important licensing as long as it's taken care of, I'm not too concerned about it.
0:12:45.220 --> 0:12:45.380
Interviewer
OK.
0:12:41.390 --> 0:12:47.200
Candidate
Price would probably be the last thing on the list, so I think I've got that down right.
0:12:47.210 --> 0:12:48.530
Candidate
Customization #1.
0:12:51.500 --> 0:12:55.310
Candidate
Uh prices the last licensing would be second to last.
0:12:56.720 --> 0:12:59.560
Interviewer
So quality would be the last error.
0:12:59.860 --> 0:13:1.800
Interviewer
Well, OK.
0:12:56.250 --> 0:13:3.650
Candidate
And then what was the Thursday quality, quality, quality is U there qualities of the right #2 for quality.
0:13:4.370 --> 0:13:4.610
Interviewer
OK.
0:13:5.70 --> 0:13:6.320
Candidate
All right, good luck sorting those out.
0:13:7.750 --> 0:13:8.400
Interviewer
Thanks.
0:13:9.50 --> 0:13:11.530
Interviewer
Ohh, have you purchased stickers from stickerme.com?
0:13:12.270 --> 0:13:12.690
Candidate
I have.
0:13:13.410 --> 0:13:14.100
Interviewer
OK.
0:13:14.190 --> 0:13:16.540
Interviewer
Have you purchased them from another online vendor?
0:13:18.0 --> 0:13:23.490
Candidate
I have and I don't recall what it was right now.
0:13:23.500 --> 0:13:25.580
Candidate
It might have bought them just off of Amazon or something.
0:13:26.270 --> 0:13:27.260
Interviewer
OK, great.
0:13:28.590 --> 0:13:33.390
Interviewer
Have you ever customized stickers, and if so, how do you go about doing it?
0:13:35.360 --> 0:13:47.770
Candidate
Well, like I create the sticker, create the artwork for it and then on your site, if I remember correctly, there's a way of justice uploading the artwork and kind of has to fall into a couple of different minor parameters.
0:13:47.780 --> 0:13:53.860
Candidate
And then from there you just just like you would make a custom T shirt or something, I guess and that's that's how I do it.
0:13:53.870 --> 0:13:57.10
Candidate
So I custom I can customize the artwork like I said, sometimes it's a picture.
0:13:57.20 --> 0:14:0.20
Candidate
One of the kids from the team or my son, that type of thing.
0:14:0.980 --> 0:14:1.370
Interviewer
OK.
0:14:1.730 --> 0:14:5.610
Interviewer
Have you ever purchased stickers as a gift for someone else, and if so, what was the occasion?
0:14:6.880 --> 0:14:13.20
Candidate
Well, I guess, uh, I guess it's aside from just giving him to the kids and the team.
0:14:14.610 --> 0:14:15.980
Candidate
No, I can't say that I ever gave any.
0:14:15.990 --> 0:14:16.830
Candidate
Just as a gift.
0:14:17.470 --> 0:14:17.670
Interviewer
OK.
0:14:18.770 --> 0:14:23.20
Interviewer
With regards to websites, what do you look for when you are on a sticker website?
0:14:23.30 --> 0:14:24.420
Interviewer
What features are most important to you?
0:14:25.730 --> 0:14:29.520
Candidate
Well, I want to be able to find what I'm looking for fast enough.
0:14:29.530 --> 0:14:32.630
Candidate
I'm going to be able to flip open my laptop.
0:14:33.500 --> 0:14:38.480
Candidate
I wanna know that the shipping is not going to take too long. UM.
0:14:41.870 --> 0:14:48.20
Candidate
I guess I guess just the selection, the ability to up to upload my custom artwork should be clear.
0:14:49.130 --> 0:14:50.310
Candidate
Navigation should be clear.
0:14:51.220 --> 0:14:54.210
Interviewer
OK, Speaking of navigation, uh, what's the?
0:14:54.220 --> 0:14:57.110
Interviewer
What's the most common way that you find what you're looking for when you're honest?
0:14:57.870 --> 0:14:59.210
Interviewer
The sticker website.
0:15:3.600 --> 0:15:8.550
Candidate
Hopefully the everything's right up along the top menu so I can see things clearly.
0:15:8.560 --> 0:15:21.0
Candidate
The most common things I want to look at customize your own choose from, you know, assorted stickers, premade and previous orders, customer support, that type of thing.
0:15:21.820 --> 0:15:23.660
Candidate
Zazzle is the other one I used.
0:15:23.670 --> 0:15:24.710
Candidate
I just remembered what it was.
0:15:26.10 --> 0:15:26.270
Interviewer
OK.
0:15:25.900 --> 0:15:27.240
Candidate
Wasn't too happy with their quality.
0:15:28.250 --> 0:15:29.130
Interviewer
OK, good to know.
0:15:30.640 --> 0:15:35.980
Interviewer
And then obviously you've you've indicated that customization is important to you when purchasing stickers.
0:15:36.580 --> 0:15:39.740
Interviewer
Uh, is it anything that you like to add to that?
0:15:41.740 --> 0:16:1.920
Candidate
No other than the fact that I like the idea that everything is really clear when it comes to customizing, I want to make sure that the dimensions and the the artwork specifications are called out so that I don't have to try to guess whether or not whatever I'm uploading is going to be accepted.
0:16:2.820 --> 0:16:3.40
Interviewer
OK.
0:16:5.800 --> 0:16:6.190
Interviewer
Great.
0:16:7.390 --> 0:16:8.210
