0:18:46.870 --> 0:18:47.120
Interviewer
OK.
0:18:48.750 --> 0:18:52.590
Interviewer
And as far as stickers are concerned, can you tell me why you like to purchase stickers?
0:18:54.110 --> 0:18:56.630
Candidate
Well, at first I started started buying stickers.
0:18:58.570 --> 0:19:1.280
Candidate
I tried making to myself and that that was a mess.
0:19:1.690 --> 0:19:13.830
Candidate
OI started buying them umm, a lot of them had foul words on them and I just would put them on like people's like notebooks and, you know, lockers and stuff like that, kind of as a joke.
0:19:13.840 --> 0:19:16.120
Candidate
And then then I kind of got busted for that.
0:19:16.160 --> 0:19:17.560
Candidate
OOI bought him.
0:19:17.710 --> 0:19:20.880
Candidate
So then I started finding ones with pictures of them and stuff like that.
0:19:20.890 --> 0:19:23.420
Candidate
But it turns out those weren't all that appropriate either.
0:19:23.430 --> 0:19:27.140
Candidate
So then I just started making my own artwork and people seemed to like it.
0:19:27.150 --> 0:19:28.570
Candidate
And so that's what I started to do.
0:19:28.580 --> 0:19:33.760
Candidate
Now is I make I make my own artwork and put it on them or you know, combine that with some words and stuff.
0:19:33.770 --> 0:19:35.570
Candidate
Like I just put on Rudy's base.
0:19:36.510 --> 0:19:36.970
Interviewer
OK, cool.
0:19:39.260 --> 0:19:40.120
Interviewer
Can you tell me?
0:19:40.130 --> 0:19:42.760
Interviewer
I'll go into a little more detail about this kind of stickers that you like.
0:19:44.270 --> 0:19:45.280
Candidate
Oh man, yeah.
0:19:45.290 --> 0:20:8.40
Candidate
I mean to the extent I can, you know, being recorded in all, I'd say that you know a lot of them are just like music stickers, like some of them will take popular band names and I'll, I'll just kind of do like, a mashup of their names and something like that, you know, and that I'll use those for the band members or to put on my guitar case or on the back of the, you know, the keyboard like.
0:20:9.750 --> 0:20:10.420
Candidate
The amp.
0:20:10.430 --> 0:20:20.140
Candidate
So there's there's just ones that are just kind of messing around then like we did a show in Calgary, uh, about two months ago.
0:20:20.210 --> 0:20:26.350
Candidate
I was as awesome, awesome gig and I was able to get a I got.
0:20:26.360 --> 0:20:36.150
Candidate
I got a whole bunch of stickers with the name of the place on it because this iconic auditorium that we are AT and so I use those stickers to put to kind of share amongst the group.
0:20:36.160 --> 0:20:38.10
Candidate
So they remembered where we were and stuff.
0:20:38.20 --> 0:20:39.910
Candidate
It's just a little different than you know.
0:20:42.750 --> 0:20:43.380
Interviewer
Sure.
0:20:39.920 --> 0:20:45.80
Candidate
Just posting stuff to social media, you know, be able to actually give something to somebody.
0:20:43.460 --> 0:20:46.500
Interviewer
So I guess I could say sorry about that.
0:20:46.690 --> 0:20:47.300
Candidate
No, that's cool.
0:20:47.70 --> 0:20:47.490
Interviewer
I was.
0:20:47.530 --> 0:20:53.260
Interviewer
I was gonna say when I ask what your occupation is, it sounds like, though that you are in a band that seems to be a pretty, pretty big part of your.
0:20:52.650 --> 0:20:57.60
Candidate
Yeah, you know, I I guess I just never really think of it as a job, you know.
0:20:57.70 --> 0:21:2.730
Candidate
But I mean we we get, we get paid a few bucks here and there I was.
0:21:2.740 --> 0:21:4.190
Candidate
Someday we're going to be big, you know.
0:21:5.230 --> 0:21:9.240
Interviewer
OK, how often do you purchase stickers?
0:21:10.770 --> 0:21:22.700
Candidate
Ohh man, I was just sometimes I just look around the site and then then I decide to buy as hard to say I think probably about about maybe five times a year.
0:21:23.680 --> 0:21:24.0
Interviewer
Cut.
0:21:43.280 --> 0:21:43.640
Candidate
Yeah.
0:21:25.120 --> 0:21:43.740
Interviewer
And if you had to rank in order of importance, these four factors with one being the most important and four being the least important, how would you sort these things price, quality, licensing, which might be like your favorite band name like Black Flag or whatever and customization?
0:21:44.280 --> 0:21:44.440
Candidate
Yeah.
0:21:46.320 --> 0:21:49.660
Candidate
Uh, I was laughing because I I like Black Flag.
0:21:50.560 --> 0:21:55.230
Candidate
I would say that probably price is the most important thing.
0:21:56.320 --> 0:21:58.370
Candidate
Licensing would be important, too.
0:21:58.380 --> 0:22:2.910
Candidate
That's something I never really thought about but I do want to be able to because I use.
0:22:2.920 --> 0:22:7.890
Candidate
Some of the bands and places and things like that that we like to make stickers out of.
0:22:7.900 --> 0:22:15.60
Candidate
So that would say that would be #2 and then you know customization because I want to be able to customize the stickers.
0:22:16.500 --> 0:22:16.880
Candidate
And then.
0:22:20.720 --> 0:22:22.90
Interviewer
Quality was the last quality.
0:22:20.440 --> 0:22:22.860
Candidate
What was the other one right quality.
0:22:22.870 --> 0:22:26.590
Candidate
Yeah, I I never have had any problems with like a stick or not sticking.
0:22:27.80 --> 0:22:30.740
Candidate
OI, don't think quality is important as maybe it is to some people.
0:22:31.510 --> 0:22:32.610
Interviewer
OK, great.
0:22:32.890 --> 0:22:34.950
Interviewer
Have you ever purchased stickers on stickerme.com?
0:22:35.880 --> 0:22:37.880
Candidate
Yeah, it's my favorite sticker place.
0:22:38.790 --> 0:22:39.240
Interviewer
Oh, good.
0:22:39.250 --> 0:22:41.370
Interviewer
Any other vendors so that you've purchased stickers on?
0:22:41.810 --> 0:22:43.610
Candidate
Yeah, I went to Zazzle and.
0:22:45.260 --> 0:22:55.370
Candidate
The stickers came out, but they were decals so you had actually like use like a credit card and and rub over the decal and then peel the back off.
0:22:55.380 --> 0:22:57.750
Candidate
And it was just pain, man.
0:22:57.760 --> 0:22:58.810
Candidate
It wasn't what I was looking for.
0:22:59.810 --> 0:23:0.10
Interviewer
OK.
0:23:1.590 --> 0:23:5.10
Interviewer
It sounds like you have, but how do you go about customizing your own stickers?
0:23:7.390 --> 0:23:8.310
Candidate
I use Canva.
0:23:10.570 --> 0:23:15.720
Candidate
Yeah, and I use a buddy of mine uses Photoshop.
0:23:15.730 --> 0:23:20.940
Candidate
Sometimes we can kind of refine whatever we've done in canvas and so we do that.
0:23:20.950 --> 0:23:22.560
Candidate
We could just get to the original artwork.
0:23:22.570 --> 0:23:28.900
Candidate
Some of them are just black and white, so I wasn't too concerned about things, but last time I made some color ones and that was interesting.
0:23:28.910 --> 0:23:30.200
Candidate
So those came out pretty good.
0:23:30.210 --> 0:23:32.870
Candidate
Some sticker Mees does good color work too.
0:23:34.20 --> 0:23:34.670
Interviewer
OK.
0:23:34.860 --> 0:23:38.600
Interviewer
Have you ever purchased stickers as a gift for someone else, and if so, what was the occasion?
0:23:39.260 --> 0:23:39.610
Candidate
Yeah.
0:23:39.620 --> 0:23:44.510
Candidate
I mean, it wasn't like a main present, but they did come, you know, as part of a gift.
0:23:44.940 --> 0:23:47.630
Candidate
And there was a birthday party.
0:23:47.640 --> 0:23:59.810
Candidate
And then we had a two year University of our sorry an anniversary of our band and then one of our members had to go to juvie for six months and he got out and we had this rager for him.
0:23:59.820 --> 0:24:1.950
Candidate
And I got some stickers for him, too, you know?
0:24:2.40 --> 0:24:4.950
Candidate
Little birds flying like he was breaking free and stuff like that.
0:24:4.960 --> 0:24:5.650
Candidate
So that was pretty fun.
0:24:6.510 --> 0:24:13.360
Interviewer
Who, with regards to the website, what do you look for in a sticker website?
0:24:13.370 --> 0:24:14.810
Interviewer
What features are most important to you?
0:24:17.500 --> 0:24:18.910
Candidate
Never really thought of that before.
0:24:18.920 --> 0:24:21.450
Candidate
They all seemed to be pretty much the same.
0:24:21.460 --> 0:24:28.610
Candidate
I like sticker MEDCOM because it's really easy to use on my phone and my accounts already in there and everything.
0:24:28.620 --> 0:24:31.210
Candidate
And then when I bought some last month, it was real simple.
0:24:31.220 --> 0:24:36.670
Candidate
I just went in and hit reorder and and got the I got the reorder of the same things I had before.
0:24:36.680 --> 0:24:38.90
Candidate
That was really easy for me.
0:24:38.320 --> 0:24:44.510
Candidate
Other than that, I don't know, just I guess you know, make it easy to navigate around the site.
0:24:45.460 --> 0:24:48.80
Interviewer
How do you find stuff that you're looking for when you navigate?
0:24:50.220 --> 0:24:52.830
Candidate
I'm trying to remember what sticker mean was like.
0:24:52.840 --> 0:25:6.710
Candidate
I know Zazzle was a pain, but sticker me like, yeah, just there's a little drop down menus and it's really easy just to kind of find what I'm looking as all the, all the most common things that I would need right there in the dropdown.
0:25:7.250 --> 0:25:7.450
Interviewer
OK.
0:25:6.920 --> 0:25:8.480
Candidate
I didn't have to hunt around for him.
0:25:9.890 --> 0:25:10.400
Interviewer
Alright.
0:25:10.450 --> 0:25:12.800
Interviewer
Uh, you mentioned customization.
0:25:12.810 --> 0:25:15.390
Interviewer
Can you elaborate on why customization is important for you?
0:25:16.150 --> 0:25:23.910
Candidate
Oh yeah because you know like if I want to have some artwork and then I want to put words over it or otherwise.
0:25:23.920 --> 0:25:29.670
Candidate
You know, consolidate, you know, something else that somebody else has drawn with what I've drawn.
0:25:29.680 --> 0:25:31.890
Candidate
And and I don't use a lot of.
0:25:31.960 --> 0:25:34.150
Candidate
I've never bought any of the premade stickers.
0:25:34.160 --> 0:25:41.960
Candidate
I always do my own custom artwork and so like there's a guy that's got a tattoo of a dragon.
0:25:41.970 --> 0:25:43.520
Candidate
So I did the dragon.
0:25:43.530 --> 0:25:48.750

Kind of ahead in a sticker and gave it to him and his girlfriend and that type of thing.
0:25:49.540 --> 0:25:50.550
