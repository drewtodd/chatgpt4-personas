0:1:32.980 --> 0:1:35.70
Participant
I put them on the bike and I put them on.
0:1:35.80 --> 0:1:39.160
Participant
I got out some on my laptop and I hand them out to friends and stuff like that.
0:1:39.170 --> 0:1:39.820
Participant
They're kind of fun.
0:1:40.520 --> 0:1:41.470
Interviewer
OK, cool.
0:1:42.520 --> 0:1:44.40
Interviewer
What kinds of stickers do you like?
0:1:46.120 --> 0:2:0.480
Participant
Umm, sometimes I just get him with just words on them, and sometimes I'll come U with some artwork and and I'll maybe even use some AI art like I have lately and been using that to to in combination with words or sometimes just the art itself.
0:2:2.160 --> 0:2:2.510
Interviewer
Cool.
0:2:2.670 --> 0:2:4.290
Interviewer
What motivates you to purchase stickers?
0:2:5.970 --> 0:2:6.420
Participant
I don't know.
0:2:6.430 --> 0:2:11.770
Participant
Sometimes it just kind of comes to me like I don't really know where the inspiration comes from.
0:2:11.780 --> 0:2:17.940
Participant
Sometimes I'll be talking with friends and I'll think, hey, I should get him a sticker to, you know, put on something.
0:2:18.870 --> 0:2:19.30
Interviewer
Cool.
0:2:20.460 --> 0:2:22.860
Interviewer
And how often do you typically purchase stickers?
0:2:24.80 --> 0:2:25.600
Participant
Ohh man.
0:2:27.430 --> 0:2:28.420
Participant
That's a tough one.
0:2:28.690 --> 0:2:31.970
Participant
I purchased him a couple times last year, so maybe twice a year.
0:2:32.920 --> 0:2:42.690
Interviewer
OK, so I'm gonna list 4 qualities and I want you to rank them in order for the first being the most important and the 4th being the least important.
0:2:42.860 --> 0:2:44.710
Interviewer
How would you identify these factors?
0:2:45.40 --> 0:2:55.750
Interviewer
They are price quality, licensing, which might be like video games or Marvel heroes or sports teams, stuff like that, and customization.
0:2:55.760 --> 0:3:0.100
Interviewer
So again, the four are price, quality, licensing and customization.
0:3:6.20 --> 0:3:6.200
Interviewer
OK.
0:3:2.350 --> 0:3:9.800
Participant
I would say that the most important thing is price an I know that it's the last important thing is quality Causeway.
0:3:10.90 --> 0:3:16.420
Participant
Every sticker I've got seems to stick OK O then the next one after price would probably be.
0:3:17.920 --> 0:3:25.130
Participant
Customization because I want to be able to say what I want to say and then the licensing would be the 3rd to the last important thing.
0:3:25.860 --> 0:3:26.780
Interviewer
OK, cool.
0:3:27.420 --> 0:3:30.810
Interviewer
And you mentioned before you have purchase stickers from stickermeat.com.
0:3:31.570 --> 0:3:34.980
Participant
Yeah, last year I I used you guys.
0:3:36.10 --> 0:3:39.710
Participant
I think for both times I used sticker meat.com to purchase my stickers.
0:3:40.170 --> 0:3:40.470
Interviewer
OK.
0:3:40.70 --> 0:3:42.630
Participant
I'd have to look it U, but I'm pretty sure that you guys.
0:3:41.770 --> 0:3:43.660
Interviewer
OK, OK.
0:3:43.670 --> 0:3:45.400
Interviewer
Have you ever purchased from another online vendor?
0:3:46.670 --> 0:3:50.640
Participant
Yeah, I used Zillow, not Zillow.
0:3:50.730 --> 0:3:54.270
Participant
What's the name of starts with a Z ZAP?
0:3:54.280 --> 0:3:55.40
Participant
Zappos.
0:3:55.600 --> 0:3:55.830
Interviewer
OK.
0:3:55.480 --> 0:3:56.680
Participant
No, that's a shoe.
0:3:56.920 --> 0:4:3.250
Participant
Anyway, there was another one that it was really cool that I used, but I didn't like the quality of their stickers, so quality was important.
0:4:3.260 --> 0:4:6.320
Participant
And then, but now when if I use you guys, I don't have to worry about the quality.
0:4:9.140 --> 0:4:15.560
Interviewer
And this might be redundant, but have you ever customized your own stickers, and if so, how did you go about doing it?
0:4:16.480 --> 0:4:17.350
Participant
Yeah, totally.
0:4:17.360 --> 0:4:22.370
Participant
So I didn't use any buddies like artwork before and try to get you guys to print something out.
0:4:22.380 --> 0:4:25.590
Participant
I I came up with the artwork myself or one time.
0:4:26.120 --> 0:4:36.230
Participant
My buddy peabo, he drew something I thought was pretty cool and he's got a tattoo and we kind of use the artwork from whatever he had in his arm, that tattoo to create a sticker.
0:4:36.240 --> 0:4:37.160
Participant
So that was pretty awesome.
0:4:39.660 --> 0:4:42.580
Interviewer
Have you ever purchased stickers as a gift for someone else?
0:4:44.70 --> 0:4:44.550
Participant
Let's see.
0:4:46.70 --> 0:4:48.510
Participant
Yeah, but it wasn't like for a birthday or something.
0:4:48.520 --> 0:4:52.300
Participant
It was just kind of handing something out to somebody, but they were surprised by it.
0:4:52.310 --> 0:4:53.10
Participant
So yeah, I did.
0:4:53.670 --> 0:4:54.260
Interviewer
OK, cool.
0:4:55.890 --> 0:4:59.620
Interviewer
And as far as websites are concerned, what do you look for in a sticker website?
0:4:59.670 --> 0:5:1.150
Interviewer
What features are the most important to you?
0:5:2.380 --> 0:5:7.50
Participant
I've got to be able to access it on my phone because that's important because I don't really.
0:5:7.350 --> 0:5:15.430
Participant
My laptop's kind of not working right now, so I've got to be able to have it on my mobile and then just something that's, you know, easy.
0:5:15.440 --> 0:5:16.300
Participant
Something I could.
0:5:16.390 --> 0:5:22.760
Participant
I've got multiple ways to pay too, like for checking it out like PayPal and Zel and stuff.
0:5:22.770 --> 0:5:23.810
Participant
I got to be able to use them all.
0:5:24.740 --> 0:5:25.450
Interviewer
OK, cool.
0:5:26.80 --> 0:5:31.50
Interviewer
What's your preferred navigation method when when going on a sticker website?
0:5:33.320 --> 0:5:34.430
Participant
Ah, umm.
0:5:36.230 --> 0:5:38.360
Participant
What do you mean by preferred navigation method?
0:5:42.320 --> 0:5:43.860
Participant
Ohh like when I'm on the site.
0:5:39.360 --> 0:5:44.740
Interviewer
Like, how do you find the stuff that you're looking for when you're when you're 1 device? Yeah.
0:5:45.800 --> 0:5:48.610
Participant
I just preferred to to be really simple to get to.
0:5:48.700 --> 0:5:57.300
Participant
You know, like a drop down menu and being able to see what I want and I think on your side is might be different, but I you can just touch on custom stickers.
0:5:58.880 --> 0:5:59.450
Interviewer
OK.
0:6:0.120 --> 0:6:5.420
Interviewer
And again, maybe a bit redundant, but how important is customization to you when purchasing stickers?
0:6:6.590 --> 0:6:8.730
Participant
Uh, it's all about customization for me.
0:6:9.870 --> 0:6:10.150
Interviewer
Yeah, cool.
0:6:9.800 --> 0:6:11.450
Participant
I think it's like right next to price.
0:6:11.460 --> 0:6:13.260
Participant
You know, like those two are head to head.
0:6:14.500 --> 0:6:15.210
Interviewer
OK.
0:6:15.360 --> 0:6:16.640
